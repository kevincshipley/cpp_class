float applyDiscount(DeliveryOrder, const Account&);
/* 
We will have one function for this system. The function is applyDiscount() which will take in a DeliveryOrder pointer and a constant reference account. The function will return the discounted balance of the order. For example, if the total balance(returned from function getTotalBalance()) is $100 and the discount is 0.1, then this function will return the float 10 which is (100 * 0.1).

The applyDiscount() function will check the account status to determine how to apply the discount:
> If the account status is "Owner", it will apply 90% off to the order, so it will return 0.1 multiply by the delivery balance
> If the account status is "VIP", it will trigger the corresponding VIPdiscount() function of the order depending on whether it's a BobaOrder or a FoodOrder with dynamic binding. It will then take the returned value of VIPdiscount() and multiply with delivery balance then return the result.
> If the account status is "Regular", no discount will be applied and the delivery balance of the order will remain unchanged and returned.
